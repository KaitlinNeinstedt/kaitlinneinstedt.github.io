  <p>SJU Photography is your go-to hub of #barbelinstagrams and a range of other photos of our beautiful campus. These photos vary from professional
    photos taken for SJU Admissions to spur-of-the-moment snaps from iPhone 5's. Take a look through our site; we hope that you will see the inner and outer
    beauty of the Saint Joseph's University community through these moments.</p>
